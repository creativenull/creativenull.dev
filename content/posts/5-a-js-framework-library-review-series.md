I've been wanting to do more blogging recently, or just be able to write quick notes, journals, documentation,
etc. So I want to start out by doing some reviews on a couple of JS frameworks, not just only the big ones but also
small framework that are not well known. Now mind you, this will all just be based on my opinion and how I've approached
them from my perspective.

So here is how I will use each framework and write a review based on that:

- Take 1-2 weeks learning and writing some form of app based on it, if need be, could change to 3-4 weeks depending
  on how big it's ecosystem would be.
- Create a pros/cons table to highlight a framework's points, preferable show more pros vs cons, since not all frameworks
  are bad, I hope not ðŸ˜….
- List out application/use-cases of the framework.

I'm really excited to try this out and see what I can find and have fun using each framework. To compliment this, I
would also want to stream my experience on Twitch. But that is not planned at this moment ðŸ¤”.
