I've been meaning to write this last month but alas work and poor time management got to me. So this
will just be a review of what has happened in 2024 and what I hope to do in 2025.

## The year begins

The start of 2024 was a bit rocky. I spent Christmas and New Year's by myself and didn't really do
much at the time. Reason being my dad had to have surgery and had to travel to India to get it done.

However, the first half had been great. There were a couple projects I worked on that were getting
traction by the client and were interested in picking up from where they left off years ago ☠️

This was good news for me to start working and maybe get to be productive.

## The mids drained me

During the last-half and the first-half of the year things did get a bit hectic with work. The same
client had wanted to resume the project but gave me a very short lead time to work on cleaning up
and polishing the app. This made it a bit difficult to get a good amount of work done in a short
and had me working overtime. This was partly my fault for not anticipating this and I should not
have kept working on the project to try to meet this deadline for reasons in the next paragraph.

Looking back at this, I should've just focused more on my life than to give that time to the
project. What was supposed to be 2 months of work became a 6-7 months of back and forth between
the ICT team of my client and myself.

Around this time, my parents had decided on working on something new, something they can call home.
This was the start of such a project along with me sort of (but not exactly) working on it. Little
did I know what was going to come next would not be good news.

## Final months - no light at the end of the tunnel

As I approached the final 3 months of this year. I was wrapping up the previous project but
the back and forth between was draining me and there did not seem to be an end to wrap up.

Meanwhile, I had another project to start working on by the same client, this time it was for
another client of theirs. However, again I was given a short lead time to work on this and again
I found myself working overtime sacrificing my time for myself 😬

So right now I'm still working on this project but things have slowed down a bit now that the
holidays are on the way. And the client is now recognising the amount of effort it will have to
take (not just on my side but also on their side) to get this project done. It's not something I'm
looking forward to next year but we shall see.

Additionally, I got another project to work on for the next year. This was a project that I previously
worked on but I had to abandon due to it being a maintenance project. But for next year we've agreed
it will have to be built from scratch so I get more control on it. This doesn't have to start
immediately but I would want to sit down with them and plan out how I want to approach it.

As for my parents and their project, let's just say that it was not completed at the estimated
time and due to some issues it has remained stagnant until next year. It's a bleak view for now
but I don't want to think about it otherwise this anxiety of mine won't go away while I think about
this and my work and it's short deadlines that they are giving me 😂

## Wrapping up

Overall, I don't think I had much of a great year. I promised in [my previous post][] that I would
post more, be more productive but it didn't pan out the way I hoped it would've. I was not able to
travel, I was not able to work much on my open-source projects, and I was not able to make any time
for myself.

I believe nothing has changed from last year (maybe it has slightly regressed this year 🤔). This is
something that will need to be rectified next year but looking at the past now I don't think anything
will change unless I have the courage and the willingness to do it!
