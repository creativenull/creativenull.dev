Now you might be wondering "hah this guy doesn't even know whats going around the world and how AI is affecting us all
right now!". Well you might be right eventually, but I'm here talking about myself and around my environment in this
tiny island.

Don't get me wrong I have seen some AI being used here. For example, there was an [app that helped student
get answers to their CXC exam questions][cxc]. It looks to work really well, until you look closely and realise and
try to manually solve those problems.

Another instance is I've seen the government use AI to build their [Anansi assistant][anansi] to help citizens get information
and answers for their common questions. The problem: Know Your Customer (KYC). They want your personal information
first, asking for your name and email. This is so they can feed that back into the AI to train. They also pass on this
information to other third-parties, according to their terms and conditions, for who knows what.

The use of AI on those examples are great, but then the usual patterns still exist. How is information taken down? Into
a database. How are stats shown? From a quick python script analysis. There are devs in the back doing these things and
I personally do not see this change any time soon.

When it comes to me working with AI, I use it very often especially for [auto-completion via Codeium][windsurf] 
(now Windsurf) in Neovim. I've been getting into agentic coding as well using [codex][codex] and
[claude code][claude-code], mainly claude code as I've been getting good results from it.

So AI helps me however I know I'm not making full use of it. Because anything new I try, I just have to question it
myself and ask "how is this better to how I've been doing it currently"? And that usually ends up with a "it doesn't"
answer.

At the end I feel like I am experienced enough to know the ins' and outs' web development that I can work on problems
without relying on AI. When I have no domain knowledge I would consult AI to get me started on how it can be solved and
what terminologies I will need to know and documentation to starting learning about it instead of purely letting AI
give me the code to use.
