Now you might be wondering "what are you taking about? AI is affecting everyone". While I hear this sentiment, I only
see this echo chamber happening inside Twitter and usually those from US and not where I'm from. So in this post I will
post my thoughts and how this affects me and around my environment in this tiny island.

Don't get me wrong I have seen some AI being used here. For example, there was an [app that helps student
get answers to their CXC exam questions][cxc]. It looks to work really well, but I don't know how good it is or if there
were any successful stories from it.

Another instance is the government AI called the [Anansi assistant][anansi] to help citizens get information
and answers to their common questions. The problem with this app: Know Your Customer (KYC). They want your personal
information first, asking for your name and email. This is so they can feed that back into the AI to train. They also
pass on this information to other third-parties, for who knows what. All this is mentioned in their [terms and conditions (PDF link)][anansi-toc].

The use of AI in these examples are great, but then the usual patterns still exist. How is information taken down? Into
a database. How are stats shown? From a quick python script analysis. My belief is that there are devs in the back doing
these things and I personally do not see this change any time soon.

When it comes to me working with AI, I use it very often especially for [auto-completion via Codeium][windsurf]
(now Windsurf) in Neovim. I've been slowly getting into agentic coding as well like using [codex][codex] and
[claude code][claude-code], mainly claude code as I've been getting good results from it but nothing too fancy.

So AI helps me however I know I'm not making full use of it. Because anything new in AI I try, I just have to question
it myself and ask "how is this better to how I've been doing it currently"? And it usually ends up with a "it doesn't"
response.

At the end I feel like I am experienced enough to know the ins' and outs' of web development where I can work on problems
without relying on AI. When I have no domain knowledge I would consult AI to get me started on how it can be solved and
what terminologies I will need to know and documentation to starting learning about it instead of purely letting AI
give me the code to use.
