I’ve been seeing too many “wrapped” posts lately and thought I’d write something in that spirit, so here goes.

2025 has been an interesting year for me. It feels like the slowest year of my life, with plenty of ups and downs.

Starting with the personal side: I’ve been working on getting a new house fixed up so I can move in. I lived in an
apartment for the past decade and finally decided - after securing the funds - to build a house. Granted, it’s not
technically my house but my parents’, and I wasn’t interested in it at the beginning. I’m still not particularly
interested, but I had to step up due to disagreements between my parents and the contractor.

I took on that responsibility at the beginning of the year and hired workers to try to finish the first floor of the
house, given how limited our funds were after the contractor used them up.

It’s been one month since I fully moved in. My initial focus was getting the interior work done so the place would be
livable. The plan is to shift attention to the exterior next-things like the property wall, landscaping, and gates. So
far, I like the place and don’t have much to complain about. The workers did a good job getting the work done, although
some work still remains and their motivation is low, which means persistent calling is needed to get them to come back
and finish 😅.

Pivoting to my career, there hasn’t been much change. Earlier this year marked the start of a major project with a
government client, which required traveling to Grenada to help with a school bus project.

Later on, my client decided to focus more on building AI-focused applications, and a lot of work went into that.
However, not much of it was assigned to me, as I was more interested in traditional software development at the time.
Eventually, I think I became more interested in it. That may have been because I was so focused on getting the house
fixed up that my attention to work was lacking.

Now that I’m fully moved in, I can focus more on my career. I’d like to split my time between client work and
contributing to open-source software. In that sense, not much has changed since the beginning of the year, when I
mentioned those as my main areas of focus.
