I have been away for a while now, a whole year to be exact. But I will start posting more content here, since I
have started work and there is a lot of stuff to do, therefore, more content to add here for my benefit.

I believe tooling and quick templates would be couple things I'll be posting, along with some smaller things like my
side projects that I have been doing posted on my github.
