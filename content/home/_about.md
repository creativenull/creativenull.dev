Welcome to my website! My name is Arnold Chand aka `creativenull`. I am from the
island of Trinidad and Tobago and work as a freelane software developer. I also
work on some open-source project which are mainly focused of vim plugins which
I use in my vim configuration as well.

This site is primarily a personal home page for me to write my blog posts and
add productivity tools for me to use in my daily work. It's still a work in
progress but I hope to add more features to this home page and improve it bit
by bit for me.
