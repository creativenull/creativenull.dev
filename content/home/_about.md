Welcome to my website I'm Arnold Chand aka `creativenull`. I am a software developer
and open-source enthusiast. I live in the island of Trinidad and Tobago ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¹ as a
freelance developer.

This site is primarily my personal dashboard that I use to keep track of my
daily tasks and at the same it's my personal blog, projects I've worked on and
my portfolio which summrizes my skills and experience. Feel free to browse and
explore.
